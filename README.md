I am noob Javascript developer, so if there is anything that could be improved or optimized, feel free to send a pull-request and I'll be glad to integrate it into the project

### Credits
This package borrows heavily from the [autocomplete-css](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-css) provider package and from [base16-syntax](https://github.com/Alchiadus/base16-syntax) by [Alchiadus's](https://github.com/Alchiadus). Both of these projects have great examples on how to implement various Atom features, and helped me out alot during development.
